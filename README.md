BK3-water-model
===============

These are the files used to run simulations of the BK3 water
model with GROMACS for the article:

"Efficient Handling of Gaussian Charge Distributions: An Application
to Polarizable Molecular Models", P. T. Kiss, M. Sega and A. Baranyai,
J. Chem. Theory Comput. DOI: 10.1021/ct5009069

The topology in the tables/ directory can be used with the official
GROMACS distribution, while those in the kernels/ directory need
the modified version with kernels for Gaussian charge distributions
(https://github.com/Marcello-Sega/gromacs master branch)
